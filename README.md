## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flower-classification.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the Iris Flower Classification model, execute the following command:

```bash
python predict_iris_species.py
```

This will prompt you to input the features of an Iris flower, and the model will predict its species.

## Data

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Iris dataset. It contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three species of Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

You can find more information about the dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

## Model
